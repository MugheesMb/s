    <p style="color: black"><i><b>Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky, visible to the naked eye. It shines so brightly that even Venus dims in 
comparison. Because of this, it has been observed since ancient times by many different cultures. The discovery of Jupiter cannot be attributed to someone.<br>
Jupiter is the counterpart to the mythical Greek king of the gods, Zeus, this name is retained even now in the modern Greek language. The ancient Greeks used to 
call Jupiter, Phaethon, which means “blazing star.” As supreme god of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter was the god of thunder, lightning, and storms, and appropriately 
called the god of light and sky.<br>
Jupiter does not have a solid surface being comprised mostly out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, 10% helium – very similar to the sun.It is now 
known if Jupiter has a core and recent analysis suggests that the atmosphere extends up to 3.000 km / 1.864 mi down, and beneath this is an ocean of metallic 
hydrogen going all the way down to the center. About 80-90% of its radius is now believed to be liquid or technically – electrically conducting plasma – it may be 
similar to liquid mercury. The Juno mission will reveal more about Jupiter’s inner structure and if indeed it has a core.<br>
However, Galileo Galilei is the first astronomer to have observed Jupiter through his telescope.  He began extensive observations of the planet in 1609. During 
this time and until 1610, Galileo discovered the four largest moons that orbit Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are called the Galilean moons in 
his honor.<br>
He first thought of them as “fixed stars” but over time he witnessed that the objects changed positions, and he even almost correctly deduced their periods. This 
discovery was revolutionary since, at the time, most of Europe still endorsed the theory that all the planets orbited Earth.<br>
Galileo’s discovery paved the way for the heliocentric model of the solar system, in which the planets orbit the Sun. Jupiter was known to the Babylonians as Marduk,
the patron deity of the city of Babylon. The Romans called it “the star of Jupiter” – as they believed it to be sacred to the principal god of Roman mythology, whose
name comes from the Proto-Indo-European vocative compound *Dyēu-pəter.

<h2><font color="gold"><b><i>How Jupiter shaped our solar system?</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: black;"><i><b>As the most massive body in the solar system after the sun, the pull of Jupiter's gravity has helped shape the fate of our system. 
Jupiter's gravity is likely responsible for  violently hurling Neptune and Uranus outward. Jupiter, along with Saturn, may have slung a barrage of debris toward the 
inner planets early in the system's history, although some scientists debate how much of a role each planet played in moving the asteroids around. Jupiter may also 
help keep asteroids from bombarding Earth, and recent events have shown that Jupiter can absorb some pretty significant impacts. Observations by amateurs have shown 
that Jupiter receives a few major impacts per decade, far more than what was predicted when Comet Shoemaker Levy-9 crashed into the planet in 1994. 
Currently, Jupiter's gravitational field influences numerous asteroids that have clustered into the regions preceding and following Jupiter in its orbit around the 
sun. These are known as the Trojan asteroids, after three large asteroids there, Agamemnon, Achilles and Hector. Their names were drawn from the Iliad, Homer's epic 
about the Trojan War.

<h2><font color="gold"><b><i>Could there be life on Jupiter?</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: black;"><i><b>Jupiter's atmosphere grows warmer with depth, reaching room temperature, or 70 degrees F (21 degrees C), at an altitude where the 
atmospheric pressure is about 10 times as great as it is on Earth. Scientists suspect that if Jupiter has any form of life, it might dwell at this level, and it 
would have to be airborne. However, researchers have found no evidence for life on Jupiter.

		<h2 style="font-size:35px;"><font color="yellow"><b><i>CONCLUSION:</i></b></font></h2>
		<p style="color: black"><i><b>Jupiter's magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of Earth, ranging from 4.2 gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator to 
10–14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots).[62] This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents—
swirling movements of conducting materials—within the liquid metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas 
torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the 
atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole 
magnetic field into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6–30 MHz.
