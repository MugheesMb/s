    <p><i>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the
Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a 
solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.<br>&nbsp

Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial
 radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi). Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and 
 Titan. Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3,
 only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of
 which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.<br>&nbsp

Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression,
 particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be 
 large and rich in iron.<br>&nbsp
 
 Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. 
 The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites, thought to be typical of the Solar
 System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass. Early in the Solar System's history, Mercury may have been struck by a 
 planetesimal of approximately 1/6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across. The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle,
 leaving the core behind as a relatively major component. A similar process, known as the giant impact hypothesis, has been proposed to explain the formation of
 the Moon.</i></p>

<h2 style="font-size:35px;"><font color="gold"><b><i>OBSERVATION:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i>Mercury's apparent magnitude is calculated to vary between −2.48 (brighter than Sirius) around superior conjunction and +7.25 (below the limit of naked-eye
 visibility) around inferior conjunction. The mean apparent magnitude is 0.23 while the standard deviation of 1.78 is the largest of any planet. The mean 
 apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is −1.89 while that at inferior conjunction is +5.93. Observation of Mercury is complicated by its proximity to the
 Sun, as it is lost in the Sun's glare for much of the time. Mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight.<br>

Mercury can, like several other planets and the brightest stars, be seen during a total solar eclipse.<br>

Like the Moon and Venus, Mercury exhibits phases as seen from Earth. It is "new" at inferior conjunction and "full" at superior conjunction. The planet is rendered 
invisible from Earth on both of these occasions because of its being obscured by the Sun, except its new phase during a transit.<br>

Mercury is technically brightest as seen from Earth when it is at a full phase. Although Mercury is farthest from Earth when it is full, the greater illuminated 
area that is visible and the opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance. The opposite is true for Venus, which appears brightest when 
it is a crescent, because it is much closer to Earth than when gibbous.</i></p>
