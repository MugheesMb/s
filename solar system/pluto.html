    <p style="color: white"><i><b>
	Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is an icy dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first Kuiper 
belt object to be discovered and is the largest known dwarf planet.<br>
Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several
objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the 
International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and 
reclassified it as a dwarf planet.<br>
It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive 
than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its 
volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This means 
that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding. Light from the Sun takes 
about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).<br>
Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes 
considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the 
Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. ... On July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, making it the first 
spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Formation:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>Pluto is the largest member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune, called the Kuiper Belt. 
This far away realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our Solar System about 4.5 billion years ago. The 
origin and identity of Pluto has long puzzled astronomers.<br>
Pluto shares feature with comets, like the solar wind that is gradually blowing Pluto’s surface into space. It has been theorized that Pluto may have formed as a 
result of the conglomeration of numerous comets and related Kuiper belt objects. Though Pluto is the largest known Kuiper belt object, Neptune’s moon Triton is 
slightly larger, has similar geology and atmosphere, and it is thought to have been a captured Kuiper belt object. Eris is about the same size as Pluto, but not a 
permanent member of the Kuiper belt, since it also reaches a linked population called the scattered disc.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Axial tilt:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°. It is similar to the tilts of Earth 23° and Mars 25°. As a result, Neptune experiences similar 
seasonal changes to Earth but due to its long orbital period, the seasons last for 40 Earth years. Due to the fact that it lacks a solid body, its atmosphere 
undergoes differential rotations.<br>
In the wide equatorial zone the rotation period is completed within 18 hours, much slower than the 16.11 – hour rotation of the planet’s magnetic field. 
The polar regions complete a rotation in 12 hours being the most pronounced differential rotation of any planet in the Solar System, resulting in strong latitudinal 
wind shear.

		<p style="color: white"><i><b>
		In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of  “dwarf planet.” This means that from now on only the 
rocky worlds of the inner Solar System and the gas giants of the outer system will be designated as planets. The “inner Solar System” is the region of space that is 
smaller than the radius of Jupiter’s orbit around the sun. It contains the asteroid belt as well as the terrestrial planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The 
“gas giants” of course are Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. So now we have eight planets instead of the nine we used to have.
