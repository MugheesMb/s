    <p style="color: white"><i><b>
	Uranus (from the Latin name Ūranus for the Greek god Οὐρανός) is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest 
planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas 
giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus' atmosphere 
is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with 
traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a 
complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly 
composed of ices and rock.<br>
The reason behind the monotonous atmospheric appearance is the composition of the top-most layer of the atmosphere. The visible cloud layers are composed primarily 
of methane, which absorbs those visible wavelengths corresponding to the color red. Thus, the reflected wavelengths are those of blue and green.<br>
Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of 
rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. 
In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant 
planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 
metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Climate:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>Uranus’s atmosphere appears quite bland in comparison to the other giant planets, especially to Neptune whom it otherwise closely 
resembles.A total of 10 cloud features were observed on the entire planet by the Voyager 2 spacecraft when it flew by Uranus in 1986. One explanation for this great 
lack of features is that the internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets.<br>
But all of this changed when the Hubble Space Telescope observed the ice giant. Analysis revealed that the planet had a dynamic weather, characterized by storms 
half as big as the United States or even twice in size.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Axial tilt:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>The axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System, with a tilt of 97.77°. This feature gives Uranus 
completely different seasonal changes unlike those of other planets.<br>
Near the solstice, one pole faces the sun continuously while the other is covered in complete darkness. At the other side of Uranus’s orbit the orientation of the 
poles towards the Sun is reversed with each pole getting around 42 years of continuous light, and the other of darkness. Neat the time of the equinoxes, the Sun 
faces the equator of Uranus giving a period of day-night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.

		<p style="color: white"><i><b>
		Due to its stark blue appearance, the Uranian atmospheric patterns have been much more difficult to observe than, say, those of Jupiter or even Saturn. Fortunately, 
the Hubble Space Telescope has provided much more insight into the structural nature of Uranus’ atmosphere. Through more advanced imaging technologies than Earth-based 
telescopes or Voyager 2, Hubble has shown that there are latitudinal bands much like those found on the other gas giants. Additionally, the winds associated with these 
bands can blow in excess of 576 km/hr.
