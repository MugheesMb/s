    <h2 style= "text-align: center; font-size:35px;"><font color="orange"><b><i>DESCRIPTION</i></b></font></h2>
    <p style="color: white"><i><b>Earth's atmosphere is roughly 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, with trace amounts of water, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. Nowhere 
	else in the solar system is there an atmosphere loaded with free oxygen, which is vital to one of the other unique features of Earth: life.<br>
Air surrounds Earth and becomes thinner farther from the surface. Roughly 100 miles (160 km) above Earth, the air is so thin that satellites can zip through the
 atmosphere with little resistance. Still, traces of atmosphere can be found as high as 370 miles (600 km) above the planet's surface.<br>
The lowest layer of the atmosphere is known as the troposphere, which is constantly in motion and why we have weather. Sunlight heats the planet's surface, 
causing warm air to rise into the troposphere. This air expands and cools as air pressure decreases, and because this cool air is denser than its surroundings, 
it then sinks and gets warmed by the Earth again.<br>
Above the troposphere, some 30 miles (48 km) above the Earth's surface, is the stratosphere. The still air of the stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which was
 created when ultraviolet light caused trios of oxygen atoms to bind together into ozone molecules. Ozone prevents most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation 
 from reaching Earth's surface, where it can damage and mutate life.<br>
Water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, warming Earth. Without this so-called "greenhouse effect," Earth would probably
 be too cold for life to exist, although a runaway greenhouse effect led to the hellish conditions now seen on Venus.<br>
Earth-orbiting satellites have shown that the upper atmosphere actually expands during the day and contracts at night due to heating and cooling.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Life on earth:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>Earth is the only planet in the universe known to possess life. The planet boasts several million species of life, living in habitats 
ranging from the bottom of the deepest ocean to a few miles into the atmosphere. And scientists think far more species remain to be discovered.
Researchers suspect that other candidates for hosting life in our solar system — such as Saturn's moon Titan or Jupiter's moon Europa — could house primitive 
living creatures. Scientists have yet to precisely nail down exactly how our primitive ancestors first showed up on Earth. One solution suggests that life first 
evolved on the nearby planet Mars, once a habitable planet, then traveled to Earth on meteorites hurled from the Red Planet by impacts from other space rocks.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Chemical composition:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>Oxygen is the most abundant element in rocks in Earth's crust, composing roughly 47 percent of the weight of all rock. The second most 
abundant element is silicon, at 27 percent, followed by aluminum, at 8 percent; iron, at 5 percent; calcium, at 4 percent; and sodium, potassium and magnesium, at 
about 2 percent each.<br>
Earth's core consists mostly of iron and nickel and potentially smaller amounts of lighter elements, such as sulfur and oxygen. The mantle is made of iron and 
magnesium-rich silicate rocks. (The combination of silicon and oxygen is known as silica, and minerals that contain silica are known as silicate minerals.)

		<p style="color: white"><i><b>It's lucky that we ended up here, nevertheless, as certainly Earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life," 
biochemist Steven Benner, of the Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Florida, told Space.com. "If our hypothetical Martian ancestors had remained on 
Mars, there might not have been a story to tell.</b></i></p>
