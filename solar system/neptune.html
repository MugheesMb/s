    <p style="color: white"><i><b>
	Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the 
third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser 
and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years 
at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version 
of the god Neptune's trident.<br>
Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. 
Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. The position 
of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard's observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death. Neptune was subsequently
observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered 
shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives 
it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August
1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.[14][15] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive 
optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.<br>
At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[20] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist 
at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of 
what gives Neptune its blue hue,[64] although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Because Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to 
that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Climate:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s (2,200 km/h; 
1,300 mph)—nearly reaching supersonic flow.[19] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the 
easterly direction to 325 m/s westward. At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles. Most 
of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation. The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. 
retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a "skin effect" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes. At 
70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.<br>
Neptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. Voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby, but no 
comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.
The abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the 
equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.

<h2><font color="yellow"><b><i>Axial tilt:</i></b></font></h2>
<p style="color: white;"><i><b>The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°. It is similar to the tilts of Earth 23° and Mars 25°. As a result, Neptune experiences similar 
seasonal changes to Earth but due to its long orbital period, the seasons last for 40 Earth years. Due to the fact that it lacks a solid body, its atmosphere 
undergoes differential rotations.<br>
In the wide equatorial zone the rotation period is completed within 18 hours, much slower than the 16.11 – hour rotation of the planet’s magnetic field. 
The polar regions complete a rotation in 12 hours being the most pronounced differential rotation of any planet in the Solar System, resulting in strong latitudinal 
wind shear.

		<p style="color: white"><i><b>It is the only planet that is invisible to the unaided eye, thus it eluded ancient astronomers until it was officially 
discovered in 1846 by Le Verrier and Johann Galle.<br>
The greatest factor of the discovery was the planet Uranus, whom astronomers were calculating its orbit and observed that Uranus wasn’t following their models.</b></i></p>
