Typically there is a commander who leads the mission and a pilot. Other positions may include flight engineer, payload commander, mission specialist, and science pilot.
                    Astronauts have to undergo extensive training and testing before they can participate in a spaceflight. They must show that they can handle the physical rigors from the high gravity of launch to the weightlessness of orbit. They also must be technically knowledgeable and able to handle stressful situations that may arise during the mission.</p>

Over the course of thousands of years, gravity causes pockets of dense matter inside the nebula to collapse under their own weight. One of these contracting masses of gas, known as a protostar, represents a star’s nascent phase. Because the dust in the nebulae obscures them, protostars can be difficult for astronomers to detect.</p>
