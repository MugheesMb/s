		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: red; text-align: center;">A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar 
		systems, all held together by gravity.</p>
		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Galaxies are similar to the Milky Way:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion 
stars that are held together by gravity. Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers. In our own 
galaxy, the Milky Way, the sun is just one of about 100 to 400 billion stars that spin around Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that contains as 
much mass as four million suns.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The deeper we look into the cosmos, the more galaxies we see. One 2016 study estimated that the observable universe contains two 
trillion—or two million million—galaxies. Some of those distant systems are similar to our own Milky Way galaxy, while others are quite different.</p>

	<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Galaxy Facts:</i></b></h1>
	<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">A galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system that consists of stars, stellar objects (such as 
brown dwarfs and neutron stars), nebulae, an interstellar medium of gas and dust, black holes, and an unknown component of dark matter. Examples of 
galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars to giants with a hundred trillion stars or more, each orbiting through their galaxy. There 
are probably more than 170 billion galaxies in the observable universe.</p>
<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Galaxy Classification:</i></b></h1>
<div style="float: left;"><p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">Astronomers sort galaxies into three main types by their shapes: </p>
		<ul>
			<li style="font-size: 18px; color: lime;">Spirals </li>
			<li style="font-size: 18px; color: lime;">Ellipticals</li>
			<li style="font-size: 18px; color: lime;">Irregulars</li> 
		</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow">and further divide them into subtypes based on their particular characteristics.</p>

<h2 style="color: orange;"><b><i><ol><li> Spiral Galaxies:</li></ol></i></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: lime">Spiral galaxies are the most common type in the universe. Our Milky Way is a spiral, as is the rather 
close-by Andromeda Galaxy. Spirals are large rotating disks of stars and nebulae, surrounded by a shell of dark matter. The central bright region at 
the core of a galaxy is called the “galactic bulge”. Many spirals have a halo of stars and star clusters arrayed above and below the disk.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spirals that have large, bright bars of stars and material cutting across their central sections are called “barred spirals”. A 
large majority of galaxies have these bars, and astronomers study them to understand what function they play within the galaxy. In addition to bars, 
many spirals may also contain supermassive black holes in their cores. Subgroups of spirals are defined by the characteristics of their bulges, spiral 
arms, and how tightly wound those arms are.</p>
<h2 style="color: orange;"><b><i><ol><li> Elliptical Galaxies:</li></ol></i></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: lime">Elliptical galaxies are roughly egg-shaped (ellipsoidal or ovoid) found largely in galaxy clusters and smaller 
compact groups. Most ellipticals contain older, low-mass stars, and because they lack a great deal of star-making gas and dust clouds, there is little 
new star formation occurring in them. Ellipticals can have as few as a hundred million to perhaps a hundred trillion stars, and they can range in size 
from a few thousand light-years across to more than a few hundred thousand. Astronomers now suspect that every elliptical has a central supermassive 
black hole that is related to the mass of the galaxy itself. Messier 87 is an example of an elliptical galaxy. There are some subgroups of ellipticals,
including “dwarf ellipticals” with properties that put them somewhere between regular ellipticals and the tightly knit groups of stars called globular 
clusters.</p>
<h2 style="color: orange;"><b><i><ol><li> Irregular Galaxies:</li></ol></i></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: lime">Irregular galaxies are as their name suggests: irregular in shape. The best example of an irregular that can 
be seen from Earth is the Small Magellanic Cloud. Irregulars usually do not have enough structure to characterise them as spirals or ellipticals. They 
may show some bar structure, they may have active regions of star formation, and some smaller ones are listed as “dwarf irregulars”, very similar to 
the very earliest galaxies that formed about 13.5 billion years ago. Irregulars are characterised by their structures (or lack of them).</p>

	<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Early galaxy formation:</i></b></h1>
	<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">The detailed process by which early galaxies formed is an open question in astrophysics. Theories can 
be divided into two categories: top-down and bottom-up. In top-down correlations (such as the Eggen–Lynden-Bell–Sandage [ELS] model), protogalaxies 
form in a large-scale simultaneous collapse lasting about one hundred million years. In bottom-up theories (such as the Searle-Zinn [SZ] model), 
small structures such as globular clusters form first, and then a number of such bodies accrete to form a larger galaxy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once protogalaxies began to form and contract, the first halo stars (called Population III stars) appeared within them. These were 
composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, and may have been massive. If so, these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel 
and became supernovae, releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium. This first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral 
hydrogen, creating expanding bubbles of space through which light could readily travel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60. Such stars are 
likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than 
hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.</p>
	<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Evolution:</i></b></h1>
	<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">Within a billion years of a galaxy's formation, key structures begin to appear. Globular clusters, the 
central supermassive black hole, and a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to 
play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, 
galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.</p>
