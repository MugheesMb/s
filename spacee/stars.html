		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: gold"><b>THE STARS</b></h1>
		<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>A star is born:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: white;"><b><em>The life cycle of a star spans billions of years. As a general rule, the more massive the star, the shorter its life span.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Birth takes place inside hydrogen-based dust clouds called nebulae. Over the course of thousands of years, gravity causes pockets of dense matter inside 
the nebula to collapse under their own weight. One of these contracting masses of gas, known as a protostar, represents a star’s nascent phase. Because the dust in 
the nebulae obscures them, protostars can be difficult for astronomers to detect.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp As a protostar gets smaller, it spins faster because of the conservation of angular momentum—the same principle that causes a spinning ice skater to 
accelerate when she pulls in her arms. Increasing pressure creates rising temperatures, and during this time, a star enters what is known as the relatively brief T 
Tauri phase.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Millions of years later, when the core temperature climbs to about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), nuclear fusion begins, 
igniting the core and setting off the next—and longest—stage of a star’s life, known as its main sequence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Most of the stars in our galaxy, including the sun, are categorized as main sequence stars. They exist in a stable state of nuclear fusion, converting 
hydrogen to helium and radiating x-rays. This process emits an enormous amount of energy, keeping the star hot and shining brightly.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>Where do stars come from?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>According to current star formation theory, stars are born as clumps within gigantic gas clouds that collapse in on themselves. The 
cloud’s material heats up as it falls inward under the force of its own gravity.<br>
When the gas reaches about 10 million K (18 million °F), hydrogen nuclei begin to fuse into helium nuclei, and the star is born. Energy from nuclear fusion radiates 
outward from the center of the burgeoning star, and gradually halts the gas cloud’s collapse.</em></b></p>

<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>Types of Stars:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>A star’s color relies on its temperature: hotter stars emit bluer light and cooler stars emit redder light. Temperature is also correlated to 
mass. Red dwarf stars have as little as 0.075 solar masses and a visible surface temperature less than 4,000 K. The most massive star known is R136a1, a Wolf-Rayet 
star 265 times the Sun’s mass — its visible surface temperature hovers at a searing 50,000 K.<br>
The most massive (and hottest) stars exhaust their energy supply within a few million years, while tiny and cool red dwarf stars can keep on burning for many billions 
of years.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>Why are stars so bright?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>I think of stars being rather faint because they are so far away! Most stars are very similar to our sun. In fact the sun is a 
pretty normal kind of star. It's much brighter than the other stars because it is close by. Even the closest star (other than the sun) is very far away. To give you 
an idea of how far, we can compare the time that it takes for light to travel from one place to another. Light is very, very fast; it travels 186,000 miles in one 
second.<br>
Even so it takes about eight minutes for light to travel from the sun to the earth. How long does it take for light from the sun to travel to the nearest star? Over 
four YEARS!<br>
When you look at the stars at night, some are closer and some are farther. Most of the stars that are the brightest are also the closest to us. The farther away the 
star is, the fainter it is.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>What is a baby star like?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>Baby stars are born in big, dark clouds of gas and dust. They start out all wrapped up in these clouds, like blankets protecting 
them. But there is one thing about baby stars you might not expect. They start out BIG and get smaller as they grow older! That is because the baby stars are formed 
out of those clouds, and gravity pulls them together to make a star. The baby star starts out big and cool, surrounded by clouds, so you can't see it. But as it gets
older, it gets hotter and brighter. The clouds are blown away and then you can see the baby star (now more like a "toddler").</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>How fast does a shooting star go?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>As you probably know, a "shooting star" is actually a meteor, a tiny bit of rock in space. Meteors are moving very fast, which is 
why they burn up when they hit our earth's atmosphere and make a nice, bright "shooting star." Once meteors hit Earth's atmosphere they are traveleling at least 25 
miles per hour. But some go as fast as 160,000 miles an hour!</em></b></p>
