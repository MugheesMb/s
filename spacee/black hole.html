		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: orange"><b>THE BLACK HOLE</b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: red; text-align: center;">A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can 
not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>How Big Are Black Holes?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one 
atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many 
stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists 
have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way 
galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.

<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>How Do Black Holes Form?</i></b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a 
supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.</p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>If Black Holes Are "Black," How Do Scientists Know They Are There?</i></b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the black hole. 
But scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole. Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying 
around, or orbiting, a black hole.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light can not be seen with human eyes. 
Scientists use satellites and telescopes in space to see the high-energy light.</p>

<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Could a Black Hole Destroy Earth?</i></b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Earth will not fall into a black hole 
because no black hole is close enough to the solar system for Earth to do that.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Even if a black hole the same mass as the sun were to take the place of the sun, Earth still would not fall in. The black hole would have 
the same gravity as the sun. Earth and the other planets would orbit the black hole as they orbit the sun now.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp The sun will never turn into a black hole. The sun is not a big enough star to make a black hole.</p>

	<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Weird facts about black holes:</i></b></h1>
	<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">The wierd facts about black hole are as follow:</p>
	<ul>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">If you fell into a black hole, theory has long suggested that gravity would stretch you out like spaghetti, 
though your death would come before you reached the singularity. But a 2012 study published in the journal Nature suggested that quantum effects would 
cause the event horizon to act much like a wall of fire, which would instantly burn you to death.</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">Black holes don't suck. Suction is caused by pulling something into a vacuum, which the massive black hole 
definitely is not. Instead, objects fall into them just as they fall toward anything that exerts gravity, like the Earth.</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">The first object considered to be a black hole is Cygnus X-1. Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a 1974 friendly wager 
between Stephen Hawking and fellow physicist Kip Thorne, with Hawking betting that the source was not a black hole. In 1990, Hawking conceded defeat.
</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">Miniature black holes may have formed immediately after the Big Bang. Rapidly expanding space may have squeezed 
some regions into tiny, dense black holes less massive than the sun.</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">If a star passes too close to a black hole, the star can be torn apart.</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way has anywhere from 10 million to 1 billion stellar black holes, with masses
roughly three times that of the sun.</li>
		<li style= "font-size: 18px">Black holes remain terrific fodder for science fiction books and movies. Check out the movie "Interstellar," 
which relied heavily on Thorne to incorporate science. Thorne's work with the movie's special effects team led to scientists' improved understanding 
of how distant stars might appear when seen near a fast-spinning black hole.</li>
