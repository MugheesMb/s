		<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>What Is a Satellite?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: white;"><b><em>A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is 
a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.
Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help 
meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help 
scientists better understand the solar system and universe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. A group of more than 
20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.<br>
A satellite is an object in space that orbits or circles around a bigger object. There are two kinds of satellites: natural (such as the moon orbiting the Earth) or
artificial (such as the International Space Station orbiting the Earth).<br>
There are dozens upon dozens of natural satellites in the solar system, with almost every planet having at least one moon. Saturn, for example, has at least 53 natural
satellites, and between 2004 and 2017, it also had an artificial one â€” the Cassini spacecraft, which explored the ringed planet and its moons.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Artificial satellites, however, did not become a reality until the mid-20th century. The first artificial satellite was Sputnik, a Russian beach-ball-size space probe 
that lifted off on Oct. 4, 1957. That act shocked much of the western world, as it was believed the Soviets did not have the capability to send satellites into space.

<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>What Are the Parts of a Satellite?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>Satellites come in many shapes and sizes. But most have at least two parts in common - an antenna and a power source. The antenna sends
and receives information, often to and from Earth. The power source can be a solar panel or battery. Solar panels make power by turning sunlight into electricity.
Many NASA satellites carry cameras and scientific sensors. Sometimes these instruments point toward Earth to gather information about its land, air and water. Other 
times they face toward space to collect data from the solar system and universe.

<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>How Do Satellites Orbit Earth?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>Most satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits Earth when its speed is balanced by the pull of Earth's 
gravity. Without this balance, the satellite would fly in a straight line off into space or fall back to Earth. Satellites orbit Earth at different heights, 
different speeds and along different paths. The two most common types of orbit are "geostationary" (jee-oh-STAY-shun-air-ee) and "polar."<br>
&nbsp &nbsp A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves in the same direction and at the same rate Earth is spinning. From Earth, 
a geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since it is always above the same location.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole. As Earth spins underneath, these satellites can scan the entire globe, 
one strip at a time.</em></b></p>

<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>How Satellites Work?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>A satellite is any object that moves in a curved path around a planet. The moon is Earth's original, natural satellite, and there are
many man-made (artificial) satellites, usually closer to Earth. The path a satellite follows is an orbit, which sometimes takes the shape of a circle.<br>
To understand why satellites move this way, we must revisit our friend Newton. Newton proposed that a force -- gravity -- exists between any two objects in the
universe. If it weren't for this force, a satellite in motion near a planet would continue in motion at the same speed and in the same direction -- a straight line.
This straight-line inertial path of a satellite, however, is balanced by a strong gravitational attraction directed toward the center of the planet.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: gold;"><b><i>End of life:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>When satellites reach the end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the 
option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary 
constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. 
Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th artificial satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of March 2015, as well as the upper stage of its launch 
rocket.<br>
Instead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.[22] As of 2002, the FCC requires all geostationary
satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch.[23] In cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting, the major 
variable is the solar flux, and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself, and the gravitational perturbations generated by the Sun
and the Moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges, whether above or below sea level). The nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and 
temperatures is 78 km, with a range between 72 and 84 km. Solar panels, however, are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95 km.
