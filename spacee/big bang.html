		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: black;"><b>THE BIG BANG THEORY</b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: gold; text-align: center;">Astronomers combine mathematical models with observations to develop workable 
theories of how the Universe came to be. The mathematical underpinnings of the Big Bang theory include Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity 
along with standard theories of fundamental particles. Today NASA spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope continue 
measuring the expansion of the Universe.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Background Radiation:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">According to the theories of physics, if we were to look at the Universe one second after the Big 
Bang, what we would see is a 10-billion degree sea of neutrons, protons, electrons, anti-electrons (positrons), photons, and neutrinos. Then, as time 
went on, we would see the Universe cool, the neutrons either decaying into protons and electrons or combining with protons to make deuterium (an isotope
of hydrogen). As it continued to cool, it would eventually reach the temperature where electrons combined with nuclei to form neutral atoms. Before this
"recombination" occurred, the Universe would have been opaque because the free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight 
scatters from the water droplets in clouds. But when the free electrons were absorbed to form neutral atoms, the Universe suddenly became transparent. 
Those same photons - the afterglow of the Big Bang known as cosmic background radiation - can be observed today.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">NASA has launched two missions to study the cosmic background radiation, taking "baby pictures" of the 
Universe only 400,000 years after it was born. The first of these was the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). In 1992, the COBE team announced that 
they had mapped the primordial hot and cold spots in cosmic background radiation. These spots are related to the gravitational field in the early 
Universe and form the seeds of the giant clusters of galaxies that stretch hundreds of millions of light years across the Universe. This work earned 
NASA's Dr. John C. Mather and George F. Smoot of the University of California the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The second mission to examine the cosmic background radiation was the Wilkinson Microware Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). With greatly
improved resolution compared to COBE, WMAP surveyed the entire sky, measuring temperature differences of the microwave radiation that is nearly 
uniformly distributed across the Universe. The picture shows a map of the sky, with hot regions in red and cooler regions in blue. By combining this 
evidence with theoretical models of the Universe, scientists have concluded that the Universe is "flat," meaning that, on cosmological scales, the 
geometry of space satisfies the rules of Euclidean geometry (e.g., parallel lines never meet, the ratio of circle circumference to diameter is pi, etc).<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A third mission, Planck, led by the European Space Agency with significant participation from NASA, was. launched in 2009.  
Planck is making the most accurate maps of the microwave background radiation yet. With instruments sensitive to temperature variations of a few 
millionths of a degree, and mapping the full sky over 9 wavelength bands, it measures the fluctuations of the temperature of the CMB with an accuracy 
set by fundamental astrophysical limits.</p>

		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Inflation:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">Recent research has introduced two wrinkles into the inflation theory's cosmic narrative. Work by 
Steinhardt and others suggests that inflation would have stopped in some regions (such as our observable universe) but continued in others, producing 
an array of separate territories with "every conceivable set of cosmological properties," as Steinhardt puts it. Many physicists find this "multiverse"
picture distasteful, because it makes an infinite number of untestable predictions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On the experimental front, cosmologists expect that inflation should have produced galaxy-spanning gravitational waves in the 
CMB just as it produced slight temperature and density variations. Current experiments should be sensitive enough to find them, but the primordial 
space-time ripples haven't shown up (despite one false alarm in 2014).<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many researchers await more precise CMB measurements that could kill, or validate, the many inflation models that still stand. 
Other physicists, however, don't see the cosmos's smoothness as a problem at all â€” it started off uniform and needs no explanation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While experimentalists strive for new levels of precision, some theorists have turned away from inflation to seek other ways 
to squash the universe flat. Steinhardt, for instance, is working on a "big bounce" model, which pushes the starting clock back even further, to an 
earlier period of contraction that smoothed space-time and set the stage for an explosive expansion. He hopes that before too long, new signatures, in 
addition to problems like the lack of primordial gravitational waves, will set cosmologists up with a new creation story to tell. "Are there any other 
observable features to look for?" Steinhardt said, "Ask me again in a few years and I hope to have an answer."</p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Dark Energy:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">During the years following Hubble and COBE, the picture of the Big Bang gradually became clearer. But 
in 1996, observations of very distant supernovae required a dramatic change in the picture. It had always been assumed that the matter of the Universe 
would slow its rate of expansion. Mass creates gravity, gravity creates pull, the pulling must slow the expansion. But supernovae observations showed 
that the expansion of the Universe, rather than slowing, is accelerating. Something, not like matter and not like ordinary energy, is pushing the 
galaxies apart. This "stuff" has been dubbed dark energy, but to give it a name is not to understand it. Whether dark energy is a type of dynamical 
fluid, heretofore unknown to physics, or whether it is a property of the vacuum of empty space, or whether it is some modification to general 
relativity is not yet known.</p>
