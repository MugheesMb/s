		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>What is an astronaut?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: yellow;"><em>An astronaut is a person who is specially trained to travel into outer space. Astronauts aboard a spacecraft may have different 
responsibilities. Typically there is a commander who leads the mission and a pilot. Other positions may include flight engineer, payload commander, mission specialist,
and science pilot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Astronauts have to undergo extensive training and testing before they can participate in a spaceflight. They must show that they can handle the physical rigors from 
the high gravity of launch to the weightlessness of orbit. They also must be technically knowledgeable and able to handle stressful situations that may arise during 
the mission.

		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Famous astronauts:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: red;"><em>There are some famous astronouts:</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li style="color: red;">Buzz Aldrin (1930) - Buzz Aldrin was the second person to walk on the Moon. He was the pilot for the lunar module on the Apollo 11.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Neil Armstrong (1930 - 2012) - Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the Moon. When he stepped onto the Moon he made the famous statement 
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Neil was also part of the Gemini VIII mission which was the first time two vehicles successfully docked 
in space.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Guion Bluford (1942) - Guion Bluford was the first African American in space. Guion flew on four different space shuttle missions starting as a 
mission specialist on the Challenger in 1983. He also was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force where he flew 144 missions during the Vietnam War.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Yuri Gagarin (1934 - 1968) - Yuri Gagarin was a Russian cosmonaut. He was the first human to travel into outer space and orbit the Earth. He was 
aboard the Vostok spacecraft when it successfully orbited the Earth in 1961.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Gus Grissom (1926 - 1967) - Gus Grissom was the second American to travel to space aboard the Liberty Bell 7. He also was the commander of the 
Gemini II which orbited the Earth three times. Gus died in a fire during a pre-flight test for the Apollo 1 mission.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">John Glenn (1921 - 2016) - John Glenn became the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth in 1962. He was the third American in space. In 1998, 
Glenn once again traveled to space aboard the space shuttle Discovery. At the age of 77, he was the oldest man to fly in space.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Mae Jemison (1956) - Mae Jemison became the first black woman astronaut to travel to space in 1992 aboard the space shuttle Endeavour.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Sally Ride (1951 - 2012) - Sally Ride was the first American woman in space. She was also the youngest American astronaut to travel to space.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Alan Shepard (1923 - 1998) - In 1961, Alan Shepard became the second person and the first American to travel to outer space aboard the Freedom 7. 
Several years later he was the commander of the Apollo 14. He landed on the Moon and became the fifth person to walk on the Moon.</li>
			<li style="color: red;">Valentina Tereshkova (1947) - Valentina was a Russian cosmonaut who became the first woman to travel to space in 1963 aboard the Vostok 6.</li>

		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Working in Space:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: red;"><em>Astronauts perform many tasks as they orbit Earth. The space station is designed to be a permanent orbiting research facility. 
Its major purpose is to perform world-class science and research that only a microgravity environment can provide. The station crew spends their day working on 
science experiments that require their input, as well as monitoring those that are controlled from the ground. They also take part in medical experiments to 
determine how well their bodies are adjusting to living in microgravity for long periods of time.<br>
Working on the space station also means ensuring the maintenance and health of the orbiting platform. Crew members are constantly checking support systems and 
cleaning filters, updating computer equipment: doing many of the things homeowners must do to ensure their largest investment stays in good shape. Similarly, the 
Mission Control Center constantly monitors the space station and sends messages each day through voice or email with new instructions or plans to assist the crew 
members in their daily routines.

	<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Why do astronauts need spacesuits?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: red;"><em>Astronauts must wear spacesuits whenever they leave a spacecraft and are exposed to the environment of space. In space, there 
is no air to breath and no air pressure. Space is extremely cold and filled with dangerous radiation. Without protection, an astronaut would quickly die in space. 
Spacesuits are specially designed to protect astronauts from the cold, radiation and low pressure in space. They also provide air to breathe. Wearing a spacesuit 
allows an astronaut to survive and work in space.</em></p>
