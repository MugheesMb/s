		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: black"><b>THE SUN</b></h1>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>How Hot Is the Sun?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="color: white;"><b><em>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, 
completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich
in elements heavier than helium. An older generation of stars is called Population II, and an earlier generation of Population III may have existed, although no members
of this generation are known yet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. Many scientists think the sun and the rest of the solar system formed from a giant, rotating 
cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was 
pulled toward the center to form the sun. 
</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Chemical composition:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>Just like most other stars, the sun is made up mostly of hydrogen, followed by helium. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of 
seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 
of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only 
accounts for roughly 72 percent of the sun's mass, while helium makes up about 26 percent.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Orbit and Rotation:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>The Sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our Sun is in a spiral arm called the 
Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm. From there, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, bringing the planets, asteroids, comets and 
other objects along with it. Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it 
takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way.<br>
The Sun rotates as it orbits the center of the Milky Way. Its spin has an axial tilt of 7.25 degrees with respect to the plane of the planets’ orbits. Since the Sun 
is not a solid body, different parts of the Sun rotate at different rates. At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 days, but at its poles the Sun 
rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Orbit and Rotation:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: white;"><b><em>A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. 
This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon (syzygy) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane.[1] In a 
total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.</em></b></p>
