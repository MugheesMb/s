		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: orange;"><b>THE COMETS</b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: gold; text-align: center;">Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that orbit the Sun. When 
they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger 
than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting 
our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.</p>
		<h1 style="color: yellow;"><b><i>Comets: Facts About The 'Dirty Snowballs' of Space</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">Comets are icy bodies in space that release gas or dust. They are often compared to dirty snowballs, 
though recent research has led some scientists to call them snowy dirtballs. Comets contain dust, ice, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and more. 
Astronomers think comets are leftovers from the material that initially formed the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some researchers think comets might have originally brought some of the water and organic molecules to Earth that now make up 
life here. To research this hypothesis, the Rosetta mission, which landed a probe on a comet on Nov. 12, 2014, is studying its nucleus and environment, 
observing how it changes as it approaches the sun.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Comets orbit the sun, but most are believed to inhabit in an area known as the Oort Cloud, far beyond the orbit of Pluto. 
Occasionally a comet streaks through the inner solar system; some do so regularly, some only once every few centuries. Many people have never seen a 
comet, but those who have won't easily forget the celestial show.</p>
		<h1 style="color: yellow;"><b><i>Physical characteristics:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">The solid nucleus or core of a comet consists mostly of ice and dust coated with dark organic 
material, according to NASA, with the ice composed mainly of frozen water but perhaps other frozen substances as well, such as ammonia, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide and methane. The nucleus may have a small rocky core.<br> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As a comet gets closer to the sun, the ice on the surface of the nucleus begins turning into gas, forming a cloud known as the 
coma. Radiation from the sun pushes dust particles away from the coma, forming a dust tail, while charged particles from the sun convert some of the 
comet's gases into ions, forming an ion tail. Since comet tails are shaped by sunlight and the solar wind, they always point away from the sun. Comet 
tails may spray planets, as was the case in 2013 with Comet Siding Spring and Mars.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At first glance, comets and asteroids may appear very similar. The difference lies in the presence of the coma and tail. 
Sometimes, a comet may be misidentified as an asteroid before follow-up observations reveal the presence of either or both of these features.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The nuclei of most comets are thought to measure 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less. Some comets have comas that can reach 
nearly 1 million miles (1.6 million km) wide, and some have tails reaching 100 million miles (160 million km) long.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We can see a number of comets with the naked eye when they pass close to the sun because their comas and tails reflect 
sunlight or even glow because of energy they absorb from the sun. However, most comets are too small or too faint to be seen without a telescope.
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Comets leave a trail of debris behind them that can lead to meteor showers on Earth. For instance, the Perseid meteor shower 
occurs every year between August 9 and 13 when Earth passes through the orbit of the Swift-Tuttle comet.</p>
		<h1 style="color: yellow;"><b><i>Orbital characteristics:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">Astronomers classify comets based on the durations of their orbits around the sun. Short-period 
comets need roughly 200 years or less to complete one orbit, long-period comets take more than 200 years, and single-apparition comets are not bound 
to the sun, on orbits that take them out of the solar system, according to NASA. Recently, scientists have also discovered comets in the main asteroid 
belt — these main-belt comets might be a key source of water for the inner terrestrial planets.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Scientists think short-period comets, also known as periodic comets, originate from a disk-shaped band of icy objects known as 
the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune's orbit, with gravitational interactions with the outer planets dragging these bodies inward, where they become active 
comets. Long-period comets are thought to come from the nearly spherical Oort Cloud even further out, which get slung inward by the gravitational pull 
of passing stars. In 2017, scientists found there may be seven times more big long-period comets than previously thought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some comets, called sun-grazers, smash right into the sun or get so close that they break up and evaporate. Some researchers 
are also concerned that comets may pose a threat to Earth as well.</p>
		<h1 style="color: yellow;"><b><i>Naming:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">In general, comets are named after their discoverer. For example, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 got its 
name because it was the ninth short-periodic comet discovered by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. Spacecraft have proven very effective at 
spotting comets as well, so the names of many comets incorporate the names of missions such as SOHO or WISE.</p>

		<h1 style="color: yellow;"><b><i>Famous Comets:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">Halley's Comet is likely the most famous comet in the world, even depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry 
that chronicled the Battle of Hastings of 1066. It becomes visible to the naked eye every 76 years when it nears the sun. When Halley's Comet zoomed 
near Earth in 1986, five spacecraft flew past it and gathered unprecedented details, coming close enough to study its nucleus, which is normally 
concealed by the comet's coma. The roughly potato-shaped, 9-mile-long (15 km) comet contains equal parts ice and dust, with some 80 percent of the ice 
made of water and about 15 percent of it consisting of frozen carbon monoxide. Researchers believe other comets are chemically similar to Halley's 
Comet. The nucleus of Halley's Comet was unexpectedly extremely dark black — its surface, and perhaps those of most others, is apparently covered with 
a black crust of dust over most of the ice, and it only releases gas when holes in this crust expose ice to the sun.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided spectacularly with Jupiter in 1994, with the giant planet's gravitational pull ripping the 
comet apart for at least 21 visible impacts. The largest collision created a fireball that rose about 1,800 miles (3,000 km) above the Jovian cloud 
tops as well as a giant dark spot more than 7,460 miles (12,000 km) across— about the size of the Earth — and was estimated to have exploded with the 
force of 6,000 gigatons of TNT.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A recent, highly visible comet was Hale-Bopp, which came within 122 million miles (197 million km) of Earth in 1997. Its 
unusually large nucleus gave off a great deal of dust and gas — estimated at roughly 18 to 25 miles (30 to 40 km) across — appeared bright to the 
naked eye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Comet ISON was expected to give a spectacular show in 2013. However, the sun-grazer did not survive its close encounter with 
the sun and was destroyed in December.
