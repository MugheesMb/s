		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: gold"><b>THE MOON</b></h1>
		<p style="color: black; text-align: center;"><em>The moon is the easiest celestial object to find in the night sky — when it's there. Earth's only natural 
satellite hovers above us bright and round until it seemingly disappears for a few nights. The rhythm of the moon's phases has guided humanity for millennia — for 
instance, calendar months are roughly equal to the time it takes to go from one full moon to the next.<br>
Moon phases and the moon's orbit are mysteries to many. For example, the moon always shows us the same face. That happens because it takes 27.3 days both to rotate on 
its axis and to orbit Earth. We see either the full moon, half moon or no moon (new moon) because the moon reflects sunlight. How much of it we see depends on the 
moon's position in relation to Earth and the sun.<br>
Though a satellite of Earth, the moon, with a diameter of about 2,159 miles (3,475 kilometers), is bigger than Pluto. (Four other moons in our solar system are even 
bigger.) The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a much smaller ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. This means the moon 
has a great effect on the planet and very possibly is what makes life on Earth possible.</em></p>

<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>How did the moon form?</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: black;"><em>There are various theories about how the moon was created, but recent evidence indicates it formed when a huge 
collision tore a chunk of Earth away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The leading explanation for how the moon formed was that a giant impact knocked off the raw ingredients for the moon off the primitive molten Earth and into orbit. 
Scientists have suggested the impactor was roughly 10 percent the mass of Earth, about the size of Mars. Because Earth and the moon are so similar in composition, 
researchers have concluded that the impact must have occurred about 95 million years after the formation of the solar system, give or take 32 million years. (The solar 
system is roughly 4.6 billion years old.) New studies in 2015 gave further weight to this theory, based on simulations of planetary orbits in the early solar system, 
as well as newly uncovered differences in the abundance of the element tungsten-182 detected in the Earth and the moon. </em></b></p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Atmosphere of the moon:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: black;"><em>The moon has a very thin atmosphere, so a layer of dust — or a footprint — can sit undisturbed for centuries. And without much of an 
atmosphere, heat is not held near the surface, so temperatures vary wildly. Daytime temperatures on the sunny side of the moon reach 273 degrees F (134 C); on the dark
side it gets as cold as minus 243 F (minus 153 C).</em></p>
<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Orbital characteristics:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: black;"><em>Some orbital characteristics are there:</em></p>
						<ul>
				            <li>Average distance from Earth: 238,855 miles (384,400 km)</li>
							<li>Perigee (closest approach to Earth): 225,700 miles (363,300 km)</li>
							<li>Apogee (farthest distance from Earth): 252,000 miles (405,500 km)</li>
							<li>Orbit circumference: 1,499,618.58 miles (2,413,402 km)</li>
							<li>Mean orbit velocity: 2,287 mph (3,680.5 km/h)</li>

<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Exploration & research:</i></b></h1>
<p style="color: black;"><em>Some ancient peoples believed the moon was a bowl of fire, while others thought it was a mirror that reflected Earth's lands and seas, 
but ancient Greek philosophers knew the moon was a sphere orbiting the Earth whose moonlight reflected sunlight. The Greeks also believed the dark areas of the moon 
were seas while the bright regions were land, which influenced the current names for those places — "maria" and "terrae," which is Latin for seas and land, 
respectively.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pioneering astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to use a telescope to make scientific observations of the moon, describing in 1609 a 
rough, mountainous surface that was quite different from the popular beliefs of his day that the moon was smooth.
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1959, the Soviet Union sent the first spacecraft to impact the moon's surface and returned the first photographs of its far side. This 
spurred a series of uncrewed missions by both the Soviet Union and the United States to observe the moon's surface. Many of these first probes were failures or only 
partially successful. However, over time, these early probes returned information about the moon's surface and geological history. The United States launched a 
series of Pioneer, Ranger and Surveyor missions, while the Soviet Union sent probes under the names Luna and Zond. Luna 2 was the first spacecraft to impact the moon 
in 1959. The first soft landing was achieved in 1966, by Luna 9.</em></p>
