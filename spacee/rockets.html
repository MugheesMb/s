		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:centaur; font-size:50px; color: orange"><b>THE ROCKETS</b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow; text-align: center;">The word "rocket" can mean different things. Most people think of a tall, thin, round vehicle. 
They think of a rocket that launches into space. "Rocket" can mean a type of engine. The word also can mean a vehicle that uses that engine.</p>
		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>How Does a Rocket Engine Work?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Like most engines, rockets burn fuel. Most rocket engines turn the fuel into hot gas. The engine 
pushes the gas out its back. The gas makes the rocket move forward.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A rocket is different from a jet engine. A jet engine needs air to work. A rocket engine doesn't need air. It carries with it everything it 
needs. A rocket engine works in space, where there is no air.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are two main types of rocket engines. Some rockets use liquid fuel. The main engines on the space shuttle orbiter use liquid fuel. The 
Russian Soyuz uses liquid fuels. Other rockets use solid fuels. On the side of the space shuttle are two white solid rocket boosters. They use solid fuels. Fireworks 
and model rockets also fly using solid fuels.</p>
		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Why Does a Rocket Work?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">In space, an engine has nothing to push against. So how do rockets move there? Rockets work by a scientific rule 
called Newton's third law of motion. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton listed three Laws of Motion. He did this more than 300 years ago. His third law says that for 
every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The rocket pushes on its exhaust. The exhaust pushes the rocket, too. The rocket pushes the exhaust backward. 
The exhaust makes the rocket move forward.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This rule can be seen on Earth. Imagine a person standing on a skateboard. Imagine that person throwing a bowling ball. The ball will go 
forward. The person on the skateboard will move, too. The person will move backward. Because the person is heavier, the bowling ball will move farther.

		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>When Were Rockets Invented?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">The first rockets we know about were used in China in the 1200s. These solid rockets were used for fireworks. 
Armies also used them in wars. In the next 700 years, people made bigger and better solid rockets. Many of these were used for wars too. In 1969, the United States 
launched the first men to land on the moon using a Saturn V rocket.</p><br><br><br><br>
		<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Rockets and rocket launches, explained:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">the invention of gunpowder in China more than seven centuries ago, humans have sent cylinders soaring into the 
skies with the help of controlled explosions. These craft and their engines, called rockets, have taken on many roles as fireworks, signal flares, and weapons of 
war.<br>
But since the 1950s, rockets also have let us send robots, animals, and people into orbit around Earth—and even beyond.</p>
<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Components:</i></b></h1>

		<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">Rockets consist of a propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. They may also have one or 
more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure 
(typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which 
usually holds the payload.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even,
in a sense, a person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use satellite navigation and inertial 
navigation systems.</p>
<h1 style="color: orange;"><b><i>Spaceflight:</i></b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: yellow;">Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. 
Due to their high exhaust velocity—2,500 to 4,500 m/s (9,000 to 16,200 km/h; 5,600 to 10,100 mph)—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required,
such as orbital speed at approximately 7,800 m/s (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are 
used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond.[24] They are also used to rapidly accelerate 
spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see 
retrorocket).</p>
