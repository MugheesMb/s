		<p style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow; text-align: center;">Lunar eclipses occur when Earth's shadow blocks the sun's light, which otherwise 
reflects off the moon. There are three types — total, partial and penumbral — with the most dramatic being a total lunar eclipse, in which Earth's 
shadow completely covers the moon.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Paired Together:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Total eclipses of the Moon happen at Full Moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned to form a 
line. The astronomical term for this type of alignment is syzygy, which comes from the Greek word for being paired together.</p>

		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Earth Blocks the Sunlight:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">The Moon does not have its own light but shines because its surface reflects the Sun's rays. During a 
total lunar eclipse, the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and blocks any direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. The Sun casts the Earth's 
shadow on the Moon's surface.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Sun, Earth, and Moon Aligned:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">For a lunar eclipse to occur, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must be roughly aligned in a line. Otherwise, 
the Earth cannot cast a shadow on the Moon's surface and an eclipse cannot take place.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the Sun, Earth, and Moon come together in a straight line, a total lunar eclipse takes place. When the three bodies are aligned 
in a way that the Moon is partly covered by the Earth's umbra, a partial lunar eclipse is the result. On the other hand, if only the outer part of 
Earth's shadow covers the Moon, a penumbral lunar eclipse takes place.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Earth's umbra extends into space far beyond the orbit of the moon. This means that Earth's antumbra plays no role in lunar eclipses.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>Only at Full Moon:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Total lunar eclipses happen only when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is Full Moon.</li>
			<li>At the same time, the Moon is at (or very near) a lunar node, so the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are aligned in a straight (or nearly 
straight) line.</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">This is because the plane of the Moon's orbital path around Earth is inclined at an angle of 5° to 
Earth's orbital plane around the Sun, also known as the ecliptic. The points where the two orbital planes meet are called lunar nodes. Lunar eclipses 
occur when a Full Moon happens near a lunar node.</p>
		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>The Moon Looks Red:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Even though Earth blocks sunlight from directly reaching the surface of the Moon during a total 
lunar eclipse, the Moon is still visible to the naked eye. This is because Earth's atmosphere bends sunlight and indirectly lights up the Moon's 
surface.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it gets refracted towards the Earth's surface, and part of it—the colors with 
shorter wavelengths—gets scattered and filtered out, while the rest, colors with longer wavelengths like orange and red, passes through the atmosphere.
This light is once again refracted towards the surface of the fully eclipsed Moon, thus illuminating it in a reddish-orange glow. Because of this, a 
total lunar eclipse is sometimes colloquially called a Blood Moon.</p>
		<h2 style="color: black;"><b><i>Different Colored Eclipses:</i></b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">A lunar eclipse can also be yellow, orange, or brown in color. This is because different types of 
dust particles and clouds in Earth's atmosphere allow different wavelengths to reach the surface of the Moon.</p>
		<h2 style="color: black;"><b><i>Tetrads and Blood Moons:</i></b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">A series of four consecutive total lunar eclipses with no partial or penumbral lunar eclipses in 
between is called a lunar tetrad. In recent years, eclipses in a lunar tetrad have also been popularly called Blood Moons. This usage of the term has 
no technical or astronomical basis and it is thought that it has Biblical origins.</p>

		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>7 Stages of the Eclipse:</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">A total lunar eclipse usually happens within a few hours. Totality can range anywhere from a few 
seconds to about 100 minutes. The July 26, 1953 total lunar eclipse had one of the longest periods of totality in the 20th century—100 minutes and 43 
seconds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are 7 stages of a total lunar eclipse:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Penumbral eclipse begins:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">This begins when the penumbral part of Earth's shadow starts moving over the Moon. This 
phase is not easily seen by the naked eye.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Partial eclipse begins:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Earth's umbra starts covering the Moon, making the eclipse more visible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Total eclipse begins:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Earth's umbra completely covers the Moon and the Moon is red, brown, or yellow in color.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Maximum eclipse:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">This is the middle of the total eclipse.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Total eclipse ends:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">At this stage, Earth's umbra starts moving away from the Moon's surface.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Partial eclipse ends:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Earth's umbra completely leaves the Moon's surface.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 style="color: black;"><b><i>Penumbral eclipse ends:</i></b></h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">At this point, the eclipse ends and Earth's shadow completely moves away from the Moon.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 style="color: black;"><b><i>How do Lunar Eclipses Affect Spacecraft?</i></b></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Lunar eclipses can be a science boon and engineering challenge for orbiting spacecraft, such as 
NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The solar-powered orbiter also falls in Earth's shadow, cutting it off from the source of its power. Mission 
controllers shut down most instruments to conserve energy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The team leaves on one instrument—called Diviner—that can watch how the lunar surface responds to the rapid change in temperature 
caused by a lunar eclipse. The data helps scientists better understand the composition and properties of the surface.</p>
